## Lab 2 

Lab overview and objectives

Traditional methods of deploying servers and configuring security are complex and often involve multiple teams and long delays. Fortunately, it is quick and easy to deploy secure infrastructure in the cloud. As a Systems Operator, you can automate many of these processes using the AWS Command-Line Interface.

After completing this lab, you should be able to do the following:

- Launch an Amazon EC2 instance using the management console

- Launch an Amazon EC2 instance using the AWS Command-Line Interface (AWS CLI)

Got the Subnet and Security group variables. From my understanding what we have done here is first created a token, then with that token aquired some variables from the account connected to the user. The commands are done to local account or group files.

After running the command pasted from the instructions I got an error. Looking at manual page all seemed to be right. In the end the problem was solved by deleting spaces and empty lines between the new dashes.

I used the commands in the instructions and got to the page.
