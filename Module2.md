Got the collected metadata of the applications.
What was done in the first task was creating an inventory and attaching an instance to to collect data from it.

## Task 2

I started by going back to the main menu of AWS System Manager window

Next I filtered by giving the prompt "Owner" to the search bar after which a drop down menu appeared.

Targets and documents set.

After running the command I could check it was correctly installed by opening the public IP address of the server.

## Task 3

Created a parameter.

Now the dashboard shows a new window.

Note to self: Read more about Parameter store and how it can be used. Apparently it is a dictionary of data that can be accessed only through parameters.

## Task 4
I gave opened the instance as instructed and gave the necessary commands:

The purpose of this activity was to show how session can be accessed without SSH.

# Activity 2 Create a Website on S3

I started by trying to use my Debian 12 virtual machine and SSH this time.
I downloaded the SSH .pem key, changed the permissions and started the SSH connection.

After that I configured the aws console:

After reading through the documentation and activity instrucions I found that I needed the flags --bucket to change the name and region restrictions.

After that I found the user and policy.

Following the link found in Security details brought me to a log in site. I used the credientials given in the instructions.

The EC2 page is full of errors due to missing priviledges.

Following the link I can see my created bucket.

Going back to the CLI account I extracted the tar file and after that deleted it.

In the next part I did a lot of things. First I creates a prefrence so all items added to the bucket are owned by the bucket owner.
The  Next command allows for public access. The third configures the bucket as a static website and the last command copies the files in the current folder to the bucket.

Going back to the S3 page I can see that static website hosting is allowed.

Following the link, the website now works.

I used nano to find and change the colors.

I ran the command update-website.sh

![kuva](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a9b770f-8bd6-4b5f-92a9-03df43a5cd68)

The colors had changed and the deed was done.

# Conclusions

There were a lot of new things in this module but the logic is fairly simple so far. The biggest problem I think will come is the complexity of the aws commands. The documentation will come very familiar to me I think.
